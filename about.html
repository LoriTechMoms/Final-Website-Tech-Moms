            <p> Our ranch house has been a family getaway for many years and we would like to share our love of this
                desert
                oasis
                with you. It is a four bedroom family friendly house situated on five acres of northern Arizona
                wilderness
                which
                was
                homesteaded by our ancestors. Perfect location to unplug and get away into nature or if you're visiting
                Zion,
                Grand
                Canyon, Coral Pink Sand Dunes, Lake Powell and Bryce Canyon all are 2 hours or less. Area is great for
                hiking,
                biking,
                ATV's, horseback riding and more!
